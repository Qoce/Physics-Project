# Physics-Project
During the 2016-2017 school year when I was a senior at Minnetonka High School, I took a new class called "Minnetonka Science Research". The purpose of the class was to have students conduct scientific research projects. My project was to develop and then test an interactive iOS application for the iPad which was designed to teach Newtonian Mechanics at the High School level. The main idea of the application was rather than just showing the students the outcome of a simulation, it would let them design their own simulation and then run it. 

It displays feeback which helps the student familiarize themselves with the relations between different physical quantities by rendering vectors on the screen and generating a graph of each physical quanitty over time.

The application uses the iOS Charts API.

Unfortunately, the development process took longer than I anticipated. Additionally, my progress was delayed by multiple computer malfunctions. I didn't get to develop all of the features for the application that I wanted to, and never got to test it.
